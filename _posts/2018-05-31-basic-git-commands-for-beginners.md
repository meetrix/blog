Git lab is a one of a version controller app like that Bit bucket,Git Hub. Because Git Lab continues to use its powerful set of solutions, focused on meeting the needs of the entire life cycle of Dev Ops. Think now you are working on a git base project. Then you have lot of problems.


* What is my current working area.
* How to send my latest update to other working employees.
* How to get others latest updates.
* Some times  your senior peoples say merge your one to another project.
* Some times you want to get privies files. Then what should you do?
* Some times you want to compare tow files or two directories then what should you do?etc.
* Lists within lists do not break the ordered list numbering order
* Your list styles go deep enough.

Those are the famous beginners` problems when using this app. So I'll give a solutions for basic problems. You should to learn in small key words. Then you can manage basic part of a Git Lab.

1. # git branch 	:-
  * Most project have a basically two or three branches beta,dev,master like that.Beginners test and work lower branch like beta.So you can 
use this key word and verify what is your current working area.
2. # git status 	:- 
  * Think some times you have a big change. Then what should you do?.Definitely you must solved this problem. After solved this problem you 
should change smaller parts in more files. Then you have use this keyword. After using this keyword you can identify what are the files you were edited.
3. # git add		:-
  * When you use previous key you can identify what are the latest edited files. Then you want send it your friends (it means anothergroup member).Then you should use this key word. After using this key word you can add your latest files within edited file list. In this process it has three stages. First stage already explained now. Other two key words are **git commit** and **git push**. I'll give you a brief description for that.
    * After you adding files you have to comment what files you edit in this project. It is not a required one. Normally we add comment. Because other peoples should know what you edit. Git Lap comment is not a simple onetime has basic standers.
      1. Separate subject from body with a blank line (Wrap lines at 50 characters). 
      2. Do not end the subject line with a period.
      3. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph.
      4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line 
      5. Wrap lines at 72 characters.
      6. Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made. 
      7. Finally type your name and email.	

	* If you want to comment you can use :-

	  *  git commit -m
		 “ Header Message wrap at (50) character.
		   ------------Break a line------------.
		   Comment body wrap at (72) characters. 
		   ------------Break line.-------------.
		   And add a how are the reported and how are solved it this.

    * Finally use enter a git push key word. After you entered it you must enter your git user name and password. After entered your user name and password ,you can send your latest update others.
4. # git pull		:-
    * Another main problem that you face when using this app is a getting other latest updates in your working area.End of the day you have do lot of updates in your app.When you use this key word and after you can solved that problem.
5. # git stash		:-
    * Often when you are working on a part of your project, everything is dirty, and you want to switch branches a little bit to work on something else. The problem is that you do not want to do the work with half the work, so you can return to this issue later. So that reason you can use this command.
6. # git checkout	:- 
    * This is a one of the most important  command. Because some times you want to move to another branch. Like ‘Beta’  branch to goes to ‘Dev’ branch like that. In that reason you can use this key word. After going you want to merge Beta branch files into Dev branch. In that case you can use **git merge** want to merge **Branch name**.
7. # git diff		:-
    * get diff is most important to us. Because some times you want to copier in tow files then you can use it.git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function on Git data sources. These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more
